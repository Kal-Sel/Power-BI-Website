# Website created with Power BI

### Ever thought about creating your website with Power BI?

I think this can be a great way to present your skills and portfolio for data visualization-, data analysis-, or other Power BI developer roles.

All you have to do is to create the website (duh), publish it on the Power BI Service, and generate a web link you can then add to your resume for example, or if you already have a website you can embed the view and let people guess if you've created the website with a website builder or Power BI.

It's a fun way to stick out. ðŸ˜‰
